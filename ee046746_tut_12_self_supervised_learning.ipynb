In the case of MNIST, we known that there are 10 digits - so we can represent the digits as one-hot vectors, which means we only need 10 dimensions.\n",

The input data is converted into an encoding vector where each dimension represents some learned attribute about the data. The most important detail to grasp here is that our encoder network is outputting a single value for each encoding dimension. The decoder network then subsequently takes these values and attempts to recreate the original input. Autoencoders have **three parts**: an encoder, a decoder, and a 'loss' function that maps one to the other. For the simplest autoencoders - the sort that compress and then reconstruct the original inputs from the compressed representation - we can think of the 'loss' as describing the amount of information lost in the process of reconstruction.\n",
